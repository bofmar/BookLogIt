## About

booklog-it is made using pure HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript (ES6). It demonstrates the use of the dialog tag as a way to create pop-up dialogues, the use of objects and object.prototype in relation to web development and the use of local storage as a way to create a persistent state for the webpage for each user.

This project was made as part of the [Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
